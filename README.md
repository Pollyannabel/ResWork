# ResWork

These are some files I created for the startup company I've worked with since August 2023. 

Full Stack files include :

Backend: (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio) 
- Tables with primary and foreign keys
- User-Defined-Table Types (UDT's)
- Stored procedures

Middle-tier: (Visual Studio using C#/.Net)
- Add/Update/Request models classes (with data validation)
- Service files
- Interfaces
- Api Controllers

Front-end: (VS Code using React)
- Service files with axios logic
- Components with forms and views
- --State management
- --React hooks
- --Props
- --Yup validation
- --Conditional rendering

**This is built using an MVC-type pattern where the "View" is done using React.
***OOP principles are applied.
